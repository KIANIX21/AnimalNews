            The number of tourists to the Komodo National Park area in Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara has continued to increase since 2010.
Data from the Komodo National Park Office noted that the most visits occurred in 2019 reaching 219 thousand visitors per year.
</p>
<p>
The increase in the number of visits turned out to have changed the behavior of these reptiles more or less.
Head of the Komodo National Park, Lukita Awang, said that the character of the Komodo dragons in the tourism area is different from those outside the tourist area.
</p>
<p>
For information, from about 60 hectares of land area of Komodo National Park, only about two percent is used for tourism activities.
"The Komodo dragons in tourist spots have changed, their vigilance is reduced, they tend to be close to humans," said Lukito during a press conference at the Komodo National Park at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry office, Jakarta, Monday (27/6/2022).
The findings are based on research conducted by the National Park Authority in 2016.
</p>
<p>
At that time, tourist visits to Komodo National Park increased to more than 100,000 for the first time.
It is said, dragons who live outside the tourism area, still behave naturally by choosing to stay away if they meet humans.
</p>
<p>
Apart from character, the average weight of Komodo dragons in tourism areas is also greater. Komodo near the heaviest tours can be up to 100 kilograms.
While those that are not close to tourist sites, the largest is around 80 kilograms. According to Lukito, this is due to the attraction of feeding the dragons.
"So since 2017, we have stopped feeding. With changes like this, we need to study the carrying capacity and capacity, lest the behavior of Komodo dragons have an impact, which we don't know yet," he said.
</p>
<p>
In a similar event, the Head of the Study on the Carrying and Accommodating Capacity of Komodo National Park, Irman Firmansyah, added that the change in behavior must have occurred because of tourism activities in the Komodo dragon's habitat.
According to him, the impact of these changes will affect the roaming range of Komodo dragons to find prey as a food source.
</p>
<p>
"If large Komodo dragons find it difficult to move, their ability to move will be slow. This means that there will be a chain of ecosystems booming their prey because Komodo dragons are slow."
"Another change is related to the roaming range of the habitat. We need to maintain the stability of the Komodo dragon and the original behavior of the Komodo dragon," he said.
