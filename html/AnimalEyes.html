        <h2>5 Unique Ways Animals See Color, Human Eyes Lose?!</h2>
        <p class="lock">
            You may have heard or often heard the myth that dogs are color blind, "Dogs can only see black and white" that is a myth that most people believe. Actually, this statement is not quite right, because unlike humans, animals have their own way of seeing, including dogs.
Before we start discussing, it helps us first learn how the human eye works. In order for us to see, light rays must be bent or refracted, so that they can reach the retina. Once light reaches the retina, it is then picked up by millions of photoreceptors or light-sensitive cells called cones and rods. These cones and rods convert light waves into information that your brain can process, such as color, shape, and movement.
Basically, rods interpret light, and cones interpret color. Animals that are truly colorblind have no cones at all, and animals that can see only during the day have no rods at all, but this extreme condition is rare and most animals have a combination of cones and rods.

    So, how do animals see color? Here's the explanation!
</p>
<p class="Lock">
    1. Cats and dogs see in shades of blue
    Humans have three color receptor cones, whereas dogs only have two. They are missing the one that detects the color red. So it's true that dogs don't see as many colors as we do, but they're not color blind, it's just that they can only see shades of blue and yellow. This also applies to cats and most mammals in the world.
    While cats and dogs have fewer cones, cats and dogs have more rods that allow them to see more clearly in low light conditions.

    2. Some insects can see ultraviolet light
    Humans have three color receptor cones in our eyes, and we tend to think that we can see all the colors in the world. But the truth is, there are other animals that have more cones and can see more colors than we do.
    For example, bees and butterflies have four color receptor cones. They can see an amazing spectrum of colors, including ultraviolet colors. Launching the NASA page, ultraviolet (UV) light has a shorter wavelength than light in general. Although UV waves are invisible to the human eye, some insects such as bees can see them.
    The photoreceptors in their eyes that are able to see ultraviolet colors are very important, because many types of flowers have ultraviolet patterns on their petals. By distinguishing the ultraviolet colors of petals and nectar, insects such as bees and butterflies can target the nectar they want to eat.

    3. Some snakes use thermal vision
    Maybe you've seen it in an action movie, how thermal vision works. That's roughly how some snakes see, pythons, boas, rattlesnakes, and other snakes from the snake family known as pit vipers can see in thermal vision, which means they see the body temperature of living things.
    If you look at the photo above, there is a special hole located between their eyes and nostrils that is able to sense very small changes in temperature, this hole serves as an antenna that detects temperature and then sends the temperature data to the snake's brain.
    That is, even though they cannot see color, snakes can still see through thermal vision. Their thermal vision is very accurate, they can detect prey at a distance of up to one meter and can detect temperature changes as precise as 0.002 degrees Celsius.

    4. Some animals can see colors in the dark
    For example, geckos, their eyes have evolved to be up to 350 times more sensitive to color at night than human eyes. This is important for geckos, because their eyes don't actually have stems at all. So, the cones in their eyes have evolved to be more rod-like, longer and more sensitive.
    Some other animals that can see color at night are the elephant hawkmoth which can find flowers by color very easily, as easily as their cousins (butterflies) do during the day. Some nocturnal species, such as the woolly lemur, can see a certain green color that scientists believe is a sign that the leaf is a young leaf with the highest protein content.

    5. Sentadu shrimp have the best color vision
    Compared to the three very few human color-receiving cones, the sentadu shrimp (Stomatopods) have 16 color-receiving cones. Thus, this species can detect ten times more color than humans, and may see more colors than any other animal on the planet.
    They can see ultraviolet, infrared, and even polarized light. Not only that, their eyes are on separate stalks and can move independently of each other, meaning they can watch for predators and prey in two different directions at once.
    Compared to animal eyes, human eyes have limitations. However, it is the result of evolution that makes the eye function of living things optimally according to their needs. Which animal eye ability fascinates you the most?
