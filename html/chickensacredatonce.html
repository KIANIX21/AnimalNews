        <h2>It turns out that chickens have been kept since 1500 BC, were once sacred animals?</h2>
        <p>
            A recent study reveals efforts to domesticate chickens and their spread that breaks previous perceptions. Apparently, ancient people kept chickens since 1500 BC.
            In previous studies, chickens were claimed to have been domesticated 10,000 years ago in China, Southeast Asia or India, while in Europe more than 7,000 years ago.
            However, recent research has shown that claim to be false.

            <p>
                Launching Science Daily, an international research team from the University of Exeter and Oxford University found that the domestication of chickens took place around 1500 BC in the Southeast Asian peninsula.
                The researchers found that the domestication of chickens was strongly supported by the arrival of dry rice farming in Southeast Asia which became the habitat of the red jungle fowl, the ancestor of the wild chicken. Agricultural activities make partridges come down from trees and get closer to humans.
                The domesticated chickens were then transported first across Asia and then throughout the Mediterranean along the routes used by early Greek, Etruscan, and Phoenician maritime traders.

                    Experts found that rice farming made it possible to make chickens one of the most abundant animals in the world. Until in the end the chicken is used as a source of food for humans.
                    The findings were obtained from the researchers' efforts to re-examine the remains of chickens found in more than 600 locations and 89 countries. They examined the skeleton, burial site, and historical records about the society and culture in which the bones were found.
                    The oldest bones from domestic chickens were found at the Neolithic Ban Non Wat in central Thailand, and date back to between 1650 and 1250 BC.

                The research team also used radiocarbon dating to determine the ages of the 23 earliest chickens found in western Eurasia and northwestern Africa. Most of the bones are much newer than previously thought.
                This finding debunks claims that chickens in Europe were discovered before the first millennium BC and suggests that they existed only around 800 BC. After arriving in the Mediterranean region, it took nearly 1,000 years longer for chickens to breed in the cooler climates of Scotland, Ireland, Scandinavia and Iceland.

            Once upon a time the chicken was a sacred animal
            During the Iron Age in Europe, the chicken became a sacred and revered animal. At that time chickens were not a source of food. This is evidenced by the findings of several early period chickens that were buried alone and not slaughtered. In fact, many are buried with humans.
            Chickens are also buried based on their gender. Roosters are often buried with roosters, while females are buried with other females.
            Chicken began to be popularized and eggs were used as food ingredients during the Roman Empire. In England, chicken was only consumed in the 3rd century AD. That too in urban and military locations only.

    Professor Naomi Sykes, from the University of Exeter, said: "Humans' past relationship with chickens was much more complex and over the centuries chickens have been sacred and honorable animals.
    The latest research on chicken domestication was published in the journal Antiquity and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was carried out by academics at the universities of Exeter, Munich, Cardiff, Oxford, Bournemouth, Toulouse, and universities and institutes in Germany, France and Argentina.
