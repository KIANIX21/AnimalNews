        <h2>New Study Reveals How 469 Bird Species Are Extinct Due to Humans!</h2>
        <div class="Lock">
        <p>
            New findings released by Tel Aviv University (TAU)
             and the Weizmann Institute of Science reveal how
             Humanity has made 469 bird species on earth extinct.
             this latest study shows that hundreds of bird species are extinct
             with humans as the main culprit, said TAU in their press release.
        </p>
        <p>
            Researchers say some significant characteristics
             make the birds easily available to humans and para
             animal hunters who catch them to eat them.
             This resulted in the extinction of 469 species of these birds.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the last 20,000 to 50,000 years,
             about 10 to 20 percent of all bird species have become extinct,
             according to the study. This study report has been published in the Journal
             of Biogeography on 3 July 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study was led by Professor Shai Meiri from the School
             of Zoology at George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences dan
             Steinhardt Museum of Natural History at TAU, and Amir Fromm
             from the Weizmann Institute. In this study they noted that
             most of the extinct bird species bear some resemblance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bird species are large,
             inhabit the islands, and most of them cannot fly.
             Researchers say these characteristics make the birds
             readily available to humans and other animal hunters who
             looking for them for food.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this study, the researchers also showed
             hope that their discovery will help avoid
             further bird extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Our study shows that prior to major extinction events in the
             the past thousands of years, more large birds, even giants, as well
             can not fly live on our earth, and the diversity of birds that live on
             the islands were much bigger than today," said Shai Meiri speerti
             reported by Nature World News.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meiri said she and Amir Fromm hoped their discovery could play a role
             role as a warning signal regarding current bird species
             endangered. He also added that it was important to know whether
             The birds that are being threatened with extinction have unique characteristics
             same.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it must be acknowledged that the conditions that threaten the extinction of the birds
             today has changed greatly. Now, the main cause of extinction
             bird species by humans are not the result of hunting,
             but rather the destruction of the birds' natural habitat.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, Israel noticed a great flood of birds
            who migrate to the country every year.
            A large number of birds return to the shores of Eilat following the migration pattern
            in mid-April.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, over the last eight years,
             the number of birds that came to Eilath, the southernmost tip of Israel,
             has decreased sharply. This is in accordance with data collected by the Center
             Eilat International Birding and Research
             Research Center Eilat), which further made experts worry that
             the rate of extinction of the birds is increasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In early August 2021, Israel's Minister of Environmental Protection,
             Tamar Zandberg, made an announcement that the country would expand
             wildlife protection of two bird species.
        </p>
        <p>
            Israeli government plans to ban hunting of turtle pigeons
             for three years. They also banned hunting for quail completely.
             Experts hope this policy can prevent further declines
             occurred in the populations of the two bird species.
        </p>
        <p>
            Policies to prohibit hunting of endangered bird species,
             coupled with prohibiting the destruction of the natural habitat of birds,
             maybe it would be good if it could be imitated by the Indonesian government.
             Because, until mid-2021, there are at least 179 species
             Birds in Indonesia that are included in the list of endangered animals
             globaly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on their threatened status, there are 31 species of birds included in the
             critical category, one more step towards extinction status.
             A total of 52 other species were declared critical (Endangered/EN).
             Then the other 96 species are vulnerable to extinction
             (Vulnerable/VU).
