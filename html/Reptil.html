        <h2>2 Thousand Reptile Species Endangered, 50 Percent of Crocodiles in Danger?!</h2>
        <p>
            A recent study reports that 21 percent of the reptile species on Earth or about 2,000 species are threatened with extinction. Of these, 50 percent of the crocodile population is in danger of extinction.
            The global research was conducted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and involved 52 researchers from around the world, including researchers from the Israel-based universities Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
            IUCN is an international body whose role is to assess the threat of extinction of various species. Reports on reptiles themselves have been carried out over the last 18 years by inviting experts and taxonomic groups from all over the world.
            The researchers have reported the results of this comprehensive study in the April 2022 issue of the journal Nature.

    Experts estimate that there are more than 12,000 species of reptiles in the world. Based on research findings, 30 percent of reptiles that live in forests and about 14 percent of reptiles that live in dry areas are threatened with extinction.
    They also found that 58 percent of the turtle population and 50 percent of the crocodile population are in danger of extinction. In addition, the researchers say, if the 1,829 species of turtles, crocodiles, lizards and snakes that have been discovered are threatened with extinction in the coming years, the world will lose the cumulative wealth of 15.6 billion years of evolution.

    Launching Science Daily, Prof. Shai Meiri from Tel Aviv University's School of Zoology said that in general the world's reptiles are in poor condition. In fact, he says, "It's worse than birds and mammals, though not as bad as amphibians."
    As a researcher who has studied a lot about turtles, he sees turtles in a much worse position than lizards and snakes.
    The researchers said the biggest threat to reptiles is the destruction of their habitat due to conversion of forests to agricultural land, deforestation, and urban development. Few threats posed by direct hunting.
    However, the researchers acknowledge that there are still limitations to this study. One of them is the lack of information about the various risks faced by reptiles, such as climate change which is predicted to have a significant effect on reptiles.
