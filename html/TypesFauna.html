        <h2>3 Types of Fauna Distribution in Indonesia, Anywhere?</h2>
        <div class="Lock">
        <p>
            There is a wide variety of fauna in Indonesia. Generally, the fauna in Indonesia are divided into three types. What is the distribution of fauna in Indonesia?
            The distribution of fauna in Indonesia was first coined by the British scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace. He then divided the fauna in Indonesia based on the Wallace line and the Weber line.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Wallace Line is the dividing line between the Asian animal group and the transitional animal group, while the Weber Line separates the transitional animal group from the Australian animal group.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The differences in fauna in each region are caused by various environmental and social factors. Quoted from the book Geography: Uncovering the Geosphere Phenomenon by Ahmad Yani and Mamat Ruhimat, the following are the factors that influence the existence of fauna in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fauna Dividing Factors
        <br>
        1. climatic factors (climate)
<br>
2. The edaphic factor (soil)
<br>
3. Biotic factors (living things)
    </p>
    <p>
        Fauna Distribution Factor
<br>
1. Cause of spread
<br>
2. Means of distribution
<br>
3. Barriers to spread

    Types of Fauna Distribution in Indonesia
    In the book Geography 2 SMA Class XI by Samadi, S.Pd, M.Si, it is explained that Indonesia has 12 percent of the world's mammal species, 16 percent of the world's reptiles and amphibians, and 17 percent of the world's bird species. In addition, there are also various endemic species, such as 430 species from 2,500 bird species and 200 species from 500 mammal species.
</p>
The faunal wealth in Indonesia is divided based on the Wallace and Webber Lines, which then divides the fauna by region, namely in the west (fauna asiatis), middle (transitional fauna), and east (fauna australis). Here's the explanation:
<p>
<br>
1. Fauna type Asiatic (Asiatic)
This type includes fauna in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java, and Bali. In this area, there are many types of mammals and large-sized fauna.
</p>
<p>
    "The types of fauna found in this area include orangutans, proboscis monkeys, elephants, rhinos, tigers, deer, herons and peacocks," said Sri Pujiastuti et al.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Fauna transitional type (Austral Asiatic)
            The fauna of this type is located in the Sulawesi region and the central part of the Nusa Tenggara Islands. In this area, there are many endemic animals, including native Indonesian animals. Several types of fauna that are found here are deer pigs, horses, cuscus, anoa, and komodo dragons.
</p>
<p>
    This transitional type is also known as the faunal area of central Indonesia or the Wallace zone. The animals found here are a mixture of the fauna of western and eastern Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
    3. Fauna type Australis (Australic)
    The fauna of the australis type is also called the Gondwana fauna. The faunal area here includes the Aru Islands and Papua. There are many small mammals and marsupials here.
</p>
<p>
    The types of fauna found in this area include kangaroos, birds of paradise, cockatoos, parrots, and wallabies.
</p>
<p>
    Difference between Asiatic and Australis fauna
    The difference between Asiatic and Australis fauna is very striking, Mother. Launching from the book Ready for Mhdp UN 09 Geography of SMA/MA by Rogers Pakpahan, et al, the following are the differences between Asiatic and Australis fauna that can be introduced to children:
</p>
<p>
    Asiatic Fauna
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    Big mammal
<br>
There are lots of fresh fish
<br>
There are many types of monkeys and cats
<br>
Bird feathers are not many colors
<br>
There are no marsupials
</p>
<br>
Australis Fauna
<p>
    <br>
    Small mammals
<br>
There are not many freshwater fish
<br>
There are not many types of monkeys and cats
<br>
Colorful bird feathers
<br>
There are marsupials
