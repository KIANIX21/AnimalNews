        <h2>Careful! Here are 5 diseases that lurk your pet cat</h2>
        <p>
            Cats are very common pets among the people. Besides being adorable, cats are also one of the pets that are quite independent and not too difficult to maintain.
            But like humans in general, cats can also be attacked by various types of diseases that can threaten them.
            One of the best ways for your pet cat to stay healthy and avoid various types of diseases that can lurk in it is to provide nutritious food, keep pet cats indoors and also control their health.
            Of the various diseases that can attack your pet cat, we have summarized from the Commercial Village Vet website.
        <p class="Lock">five diseases that can lurk your pet cat:</p>
    </p>
    <p class="Lock">
        1. Cat Leukemia
         Feline leukemia is a disease that is spread through urine, nasal secretions and saliva. Cats can contract the disease through bites, sharing food, water bowls and litter boxes, and from grooming each other. Mother cats can pass the disease on to their kittens, and kittens are more likely to catch the disease than adult cats.
         Some cats will immediately fall ill after contracting the virus. Feline leukemia can cause a number of conditions, but will eventually attack the immune system and lead to bone marrow failure. Any disease can be a sign of feline leukemia.
         Although there is no cure for leukemia in cats, it is fairly easy to prevent. Keeping cats indoors, limiting exposure to other cats, maintaining a clean living environment and making sure your cat is vaccinated can all help prevent feline leukemia.

        <p class="Lock">
            2. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
            FIV is generally spread through bite wounds. Street cats and territorial insects are particularly susceptible to FIV infection. The spread of FIV to cats through the same food and drink bowl does not significantly increase the risk of contracting FIV, and even mother cats rarely pass the virus to their kittens.
            After the virus has successfully entered the bloodstream, this virus will develop to become active. FIV targets the cat's immune system. For cats that have FIV in their bodies can increase the risk of infection.
            You can do FIV prevention efforts by keeping your pet cat in the house area because until now there is no vaccine that is effective enough to fight FIV.

        <p class="Lock">
            3. Kidney Failure
            Kidney failure is one of the main causes of death in cats who have reached old age. The cause of kidney failure in cats is generally due to age, genetics and environmental factors such as ingesting toxic substances.
            Kidney failure in cats can occur in two forms, namely acute kidney failure and chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure is associated with a sudden cessation of kidney function, whereas chronic kidney failure results from a progressive decline in kidney function.
            A number of symptoms may appear as a result of kidney failure, including excessive urination, increased thirst, nausea or vomiting, dehydration, constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss, halitosis (bad breath) and lethargy.
            While there is no cure for feline kidney failure, the disease can be managed through adjustments to your cat's diet, medication, and hydration therapy.

        <p class="Lock">
            4. Pankleukopenia
            Panleukopenia is a highly contagious viral disease of cats, usually affecting kittens born to unvaccinated mothers. Despite being given treatment, kittens almost always die from the viciousness of the virus. The virus can be spread through bodily fluids, feces and ticks, and is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water bowls.
            Panleukopenia affects the intestinal tract and attacks the immune system. Cats suffering from this disease will most likely experience diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, malnutrition, anemia and lead to death after a few days.
            Panleukopenia in cats can be diagnosed through a blood test. Treatment of panleukopenia in cats is generally rarely successful. To prevent feline panleukemia, you must vaccinate your cat to avoid pankleukopenia.
    </p>
        <p class="Lock">
            5. Rabies
            Rabies is one of the most dangerous diseases because it not only infects cats, but can also be transmitted to humans. Rabies can infect cats through bites or eating rodents.
            In domestic cats, rodents such as mice are one of the factors that house cats can get rabies. Rabies can be debilitating and also attacks the nervous system in cats.
            Symptoms of rabies can include howling, drooling, fever, and the cat behaving strangely. There is no effective treatment for rabies in cats.
            The only way to prevent your cat from becoming infected with rabies is to give your cat a rabies vaccine and reduce your cat's activity outside the house.
