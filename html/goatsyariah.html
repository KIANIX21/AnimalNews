        <h2>One Goat Sacrifice for How Many People? These are the provisions according to the Shari'a</h2>
        <DIV class="Lock">
        <p>
            Every Muslim can sacrifice alone or together, either with his family or with other people. One of the things that may still be questioned by some Muslims, the sacrifice of a goat can be for how many people?
Based on the opinion of the jumhur, goats are one of the prescribed sacrificial animals. Besides goats, other sacrificial animals are camels and cows or buffalo.
</p>
<p>
    According to the provisions of the Shari'a, the sacrifice of a goat is only sufficient for one person, while a camel or cow can be for seven people. This is also explained in the book Fiqh by Udin Wahyudin, et al.
    "If someone wants to sacrifice by slaughtering a cow, he can invite his family or other people. In other words, the sacrifice can be done in a joint way," explained Udin.
    The evidence regarding the sacrifice collectively refers to the hadith narrated by Imam Muslim from Jabir bin Abdullah RA.
</p>
<br>
<p><h2>
نَحَرْنَا مَعَ رَسُولِ الله - صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ - بِالْحُدَيْبِيَةِ الْبَدَنَةَ عَنْ سَبْعَةٍ وَالْبَقَرَةَ عَنْ سَبْعَة</h2>
<br>Meaning: "We have slaughtered the sacrifice with the Messenger of Allah. In the year Hudaibiyah, a camel for seven people and a cow for seven people."
</p>
<p>
    Types of Goats Afdhal for Sacrifice
    Shaykh Abu Bakar Jabar Al-Jazairi in the book Minhajul Muslim explains, the most afdhal sacrificial animal is a gibas goat with horns, male, white, and there are black patterns adorning around the eyes and four legs. Because, said Shaykh Abu Bakar Jabar Al-Jazairi, this kind of goat was favored by the Prophet Muhammad.
    This opinion refers to a hadith that comes from Aisyah RA. He said, "Verily the Prophet (PBUH) slaughtered a goat with horns, treads with black treads, walks with black feet, and sees with black eyes." (HR. At Tirmidhi, judged authentic).
    In the book al-Majmu' Syarh al-Muhadzdzab, Imam an-Nawawi explains, the Shafi'iyah scholars agree that animals that are blind, crippled, sick, and thin are not valid for sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
    Goat Age Limit for Sacrifice
    The scholars of the Shafi'iyah are of the opinion that the goat used for sacrifice is at least two years old and entering its third year. Meanwhile, for sheep the age limit is one year and is entering the second year.
    Scholars of this school also argue that male animals are more important than females, because they taste better. In addition, fat animals are superior to skinny ones and white is better than other colors.
</p>
<p>
    Time of Slaughter of Sacrifice
    The sacrificial slaughter is carried out on Eid al-Adha which coincides with 10 Zulhijah. As the Prophet SAW said:
</p>
<p>
    "Whoever slaughters a sacrificial animal before the (Eid al-Adha) prayer, then indeed he is slaughtering for himself, and whoever slaughters a sacrifice after the (Eid al-Adha) prayer and his two sermons, indeed he has completed his worship, and he has followed the rules of Islam." HR Bukhari).
    In addition to Eid al-Adha, the sacrifice can also be slaughtered on the day of Tasyrik, namely the 11th, 12th, and 13th of Zulhijah. Rasulullah SAW said, "All days of Tasyrik is the time to slaughter the sacrifice," (HR Ahmad).
    Thus the information regarding the provisions of the sacrificial animal according to the Shari'a, hopefully it will answer your doubts about the number of people who can sacrifice a goat, yes!
