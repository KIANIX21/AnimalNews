    <h2>Arid and Hot, What Do Camels Eat in the Desert?</h2>
    <p>
        Camels are animals that live in desert environments. As is known, only a handful of plants can grow in the desert. As herbivores, what do camels eat?
The desert is synonymous with thorny plants. Although only these plants are available, it turns out that the key lies in the camel's lips. Their lips are very hard and are made to eat thorny plants.

        The three camel species, Camelus dromedarius, Camelus bactrianus, and Camelus ferus, have adapted to make life easier for them in the desert. The camel has a split upper lip, with each half moving separately to allow the animal to graze near the ground and eat short grass.
        Their lips are also rough and tough but still flexible, which means camels easily break and eat thorny and salty plants. According to London's National History Museum (NHM), camels also have fleshy projections called papillae in their mouths. These papillae line the mouth to protect it from piercing food and help the camel to swallow the food.
        The dromedary camel, which has one hump, eats thorns, dry grass and salty shrubs. This type of camel also eats almost all available desert plants. Overall, these camels feed on grass, leaves, and twigs from any plant in the desert, including the evergreen shoots of the saxaul bush.

    Later, the Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus ferus) in Mongolia ate stemmed shrubs and some types of flowers, such as Caragana, Haloxylon, Reaumuria, and Salsola that grow there.
    So, what happens after the camels swallow the food?
    Camels have three to four stomach parts. From there the food will be partially broken down in the first two stomachs before being regurgitated as soft food and picked up again. Once swallowed and into the other stomach, processed food will be added with microbes that help digestion.
    If there is no food available, the camel will use the fat in its hump as a food reserve. Because of this, camels can survive more than a week without water and months without food.
